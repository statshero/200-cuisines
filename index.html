        <p>
          We introduce a new item for bucket-listing:<label for="sn-bucket" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-bucket" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bucket%20Listing">Urban Dictionary</a> for a definition:<br><i>To go out and experience the things on your bucket list. To be adventurous and spontaneous.</i></span> eating dishes that represent 200 cuisines. This is distinct, and we believe more rewarding, than focussing on say the list of countries or top Michelin restaurants. The rules, if you want to call them so, are simple. First, a cuisine must be catalogued (known as <i>the spreadsheet</i>), second be supplied by a reasonably authentic purveyor (and we offer more guidance on how), and third, documented in some digital form. We show how this can be done in New York City with a sample of local restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several limitations, notably, the definition of what is a cuisine. To clarify, we selected a non-exhaustive, non-systematic list that serves the purpose of a <i>cuisine cyclopedia</i>. If it‚Äôs on it, it counts. This is an ongoing effort and we recognize our shortcomings, especially when it comes to non-Western cultures. Lastly, we do not identify as &ldquo;foodies&rdquo; nor are we writers of food blogs. We have no commercial affiliation.

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          There are an estimated 20,000-24,0000 restaurants and eateries in New York City. The variety around the world is even more overwhelming. Some diets are eve recognized as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists">UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists</a> such as the Mediterranean diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          A word on what the 200 cuisines is not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is not an eating competition. Such endeavours are in the domain of the Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Contest and, we think, disgusting.</li>
          <li>It is not a food marathon. Speed does not matter. For a food marathon defined as 42 dishes in 24 hours look no further than our Jackson Heights restaurant crawl.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also introduce our personal rating scheme of how <i>we</i> liked it. It serves best as a predictor if we would come back. Gone are the ubiquitous five stars (&#9734&#9734&#9734&#9734&#9734) and welcomed is the emoji scale.
        </p>
        <table>
         <tr>
           <th>üòï</th>
           <th>üôÇ</th>
           <th>üòç</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>Confused Face</td>
           <td>Slightly Smiling Face</td>
           <td>Smiling Face With Heart-Eyes</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
         The rating is, as mentioned, thoroughly subjective.

          Below is the current list of cuisines including an example of where to find in New York City. Note that it is not complete and may be out of date.
