200 Cuisines for your bucket list
=========

### https://statshero.github.io/200-cuisines/

We introduce a new item for bucket listing [1]: eating dishes that represent 200 cuisines. This is distinct, and we believe more rewarding, than only focussing on the list of countries or top Michelin restaurants. The rules, if you want to call them so, are simple. First, a cuisine must be catalogued (known as the spreadsheet), second be supplied by a reasonably authentic purveyor (and we offer more guidance on how), and third, documented in some digital form. We show how this can be done in New York City with a sample of local restaurants.

There are several limitations, notably, the definition of what is a cuisine. To clarify, we selected a non-exhaustive, non-systematic list that serves the purpose of a *cuisine cyclopedia*. If itâ€™s on it, it counts. This is an ongoing effort and we recognize our shortcomings, especially when it comes to non-Western cultures. Lastly, we do not identify as "foodies" nor are we writers of food blogs. We have no commercial affiliation.
